# guess whom'st've

## by Eric Lau, Kazi Jamal, Matthew Chan (Period 5)

### Project Description 
Our project is a twist on the class tabletop game by Hasbro: Guess Who. Instead of trying to guess fictional characters based on their appearance, players must guess Stuyvesant High School faculty or notable students by asking questions based on their prior knowledge of the school community. Two players will each be shown the instructions and then given a randomly selected character. The gameplay will consist of the two players going back and forth asking questions, analyzing answers to "flip down characters" (eliminate their possibility of being the opponents character), and, finally, guessing the opponent's character.

### User Interface
1. Players will be shown instructions on how to play the game.
2. Players will be given a randomy selected character.
3. Players will be shown the main interface which will appear as shown below:
