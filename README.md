Systems Level Programming w/ Mr. Dyrland-Weaver at Stuyvesant 2019-2020

java .java -> .class -> jvm -> os -> hardware 

c .c -> executable ->os -> hardware 

protected memory 
os allocates memory for programs and keeps track 
programs cannot access memory outside of their allocation
most operating systems have a c level that can do stuff with data security 

segmentation fault 
 - most common C error?
 - program is trying to access segment of memory that it shouldnt 
 - sent by operating system to program 
 - trying to access the 10000000th element of an array in an array with size 5 
 
 most problems in code are trying to access code that you dont have 
 - java just had more clear warnings than c 
 
 operating system may not give you a contiguous block of bytes when allocating memory 
 they may be fragmented 
 
 char *p; pointer
 
 char s0[6]; memory address 
 
 p = s0; p now points to the start of the s0 array 
 
 char s0[6] = "hello"; [h][e][l][l][o][0] // this is a mutable piece of memory but another immutable literal is made 
 
 p = s0; // points to the mutable string 
 
 p[0] = 'j'; // mutable string is changed 
 
 p = "hello" //now points to the immutable literal
