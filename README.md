# guess whom'st've

## by Eric Lau, Kazi Jamal, Matthew Chan (Period 5)

### Project Description 
Our project is a twist on the class tabletop game by Hasbro: Guess Who. Instead of trying to guess fictional characters based on their appearance, players must guess Stuyvesant High School faculty or notable students by asking questions based on their prior knowledge of the school community. Two players will each be shown the instructions and then given a randomly selected character. The gameplay will consist of the two players going back and forth asking questions, analyzing answers to "flip down characters" (eliminate their possibility of being the opponents character), and, finally, guessing the opponent's character.

### User Interface
1. Players will be shown instructions on how to play the game.
2. Players will be given a randomy selected character.
3. Players will be shown the main interface which will appear as shown below:

4. Based on the state of the game, the player will be able to ask a question, answer a question, or act upon an opponent's answer to flip down their characters.
5. player 1 question -> player 2 answer -> player 1 flips down characters -> player 2 question -> player 1 answer -> player 2 flips down characters -> repeat
6. Question: Player will be prompted to enter a question ending in a question mark. They can also enter "guess" and they will be prompted to choose the ID of the character they believe is the opponent's character.
7. Answer: Player will be shown opponent's question and then prompted to answer the question.
8. Flip down character: Player will be prompted to enter characters' IDs to flip down, and then enter "done" when they do not wish to flip down any more characters.
